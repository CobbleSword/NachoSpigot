# NachoSpigot
A fork of PaperSpigot 1.8.8 (build 443) which aims to optimize, give long term support for 1.8x, and add useful APIs, since both Paper and Spigot no longer support the version.

**The most up to date, optimized 1.8.8 jar on the market**

## Features
Since 1.8x is ~5 years old now, it has missed out on a lot of critial fixes, updates and optimizations,
So we plan on offering those much needed updates to 1.8x!
By the end, we plan to support Java 14, Netty 4.1, allow higher player counts and still support a large number of plugins
